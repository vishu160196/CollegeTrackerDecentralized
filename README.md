# CollegeTrackerDecentralized
<h2>Agenda</h2>
It is becoming difficult to track down illegal colleges. Many students' careers are spoiled as
they enroll in them.

<h2>Background</h2>
In many parts of India, illegal colleges are run, which are not affiliated to any university.
Many students enroll in these colleges without knowing that and in turn they end up having
no jobs or colleges get shut down after some time, which ruins their career.
